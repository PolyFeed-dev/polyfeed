# PolyFeed

PolyFeed is a multifunctional insights and analysis tool built for Polymarket â€” designed to help traders make smarter decisions, discover markets more intuitively, and explore new ways to analyze data and trends.

Our mission is to connect real-time information with on-chain prediction markets, empowering users with context-rich insights.

The project will evolve through several milestones, each expanding PolyFeedâ€™s intelligence and utility step by step.

ðŸš€ Milestone 1 â€“ Browser Extension:
Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI-driven analysis, the extension will enable users to instantly discover which Polymarket market relates to any tweet, article, or piece of online content â€” flipping the traditional approach. Instead of finding news for a given market, PolyFeed helps you find the market for a given piece of news.
